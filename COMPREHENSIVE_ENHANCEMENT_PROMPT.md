# Complete Chhajer Cable Industry Website Enhancement

**CRITICAL: Keep all existing website content exactly as-is unless explicitly mentioned for improvement. Focus on fixing bugs, enhancing UI/UX, and adding professional polish.**

## URGENT FIX: Product Detail Page Blank Screen Issue

**Priority 1:** Debug and fix the product info/detail page that causes blank screens when users click product cards or "View Details".

### Root cause analysis and fixes:
- **Routing issues:** Ensure ProductCard navigation links match PDP route parameters exactly
- **Data validation:** Add guards to prevent rendering before product data loads
- **Error boundaries:** Wrap PDP component with error boundary + fallback UI
- **JSON parsing:** Safely parse specifications with try/catch blocks
- **Image failures:** Prevent image load errors from crashing entire page
- **Console logging:** Add debugging for route params and data flow

### Implementation requirements:
```javascript
// Add error boundary around PDP
// Validate product exists before render
// Safe JSON parsing with fallbacks
// Graceful image error handling
// Console logging for debugging
```

## Enhanced Product Detail Pages (Amazon/Shopify-inspired)

Create conversion-focused product pages using existing content in compelling layouts:

### Media-rich presentation:
- **4 high-quality product images** per product (different angles: front view, connector close-up, cable jacket detail, packaging)
- **1 product video** per product (demonstration, flexibility test, or installation guide)
- Zoomable gallery with thumbnails and lightbox
- White/grey backgrounds, no watermarks

### Detailed description layout structure:
**Above the fold:**
- Large product image gallery (left)
- Buy box (right): name, rating, price, variant selectors, quantity, Add to Cart (sticky on scroll)

**Below the fold with sticky tabs:**
- **Overview:** Use existing short_description with enhanced typography
- **Key Highlights:** Visual icons from existing features/applications (exact text)
- **Detailed Description:** Combine existing fields (short_description + features + applications) with better visual presentation
- **Tech Specs:** Clean table from specifications JSON
- **Applications:** Use existing applications as tagged pills
- **Quality Certifications:** Display existing quality badges
- **FAQ/Reviews:** Structured placeholders only
- **Related Products:** Same category suggestions

## Uniform Product Highlights System

**Apply these 4 standard highlights to ALL products:**
- "Customization Available"
- "Fluke Test Passed" 
- "DCM Tested"
- "OEM Supplier"

### Implementation:
- Show as consistent badges on product cards, quick view, and PDP
- Clean modern design with icons
- Consistent placement across all products
- Don't modify stored product data - this is display-only uniformity

## Website Layout Reorganization

**Footer section new order (bottom to top):**
1. **Get in Touch/Contacts** (move to very bottom)
2. **Business Credentials** (move above contacts)
3. **Services** (move above credentials)

Keep all existing content - only change vertical positioning and update internal navigation links.

## Checkout Cart Redesign (Cable Industry Theme)

### Visual design elements:
- **Cable-inspired patterns:** Subtle wire graphics, connector icons, circuit-like borders
- **Color scheme:** Technical blues, copper accents, cable jacket colors
- **Typography:** Clean, technical fonts
- **Icons:** Cable connectors, network symbols

### Enhanced cart functionality:
- Product display: image + name + key specs (gauge, shield type, length)
- Quantity controls with bulk pricing awareness
- Shipping calculator considering cable weight/length
- Progress indicator styled like cable routing
- Technical notes section for custom requirements
- Bulk discount messaging ("Order 100m+ for volume pricing")
- Trust signals and secure checkout indicators
