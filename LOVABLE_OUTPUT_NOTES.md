# Lovable Output Notes

What changed:
- Added admin-only route guard using Supabase RPC is_admin
- New admin UI: Categories, Products, Pages with image uploads to storage
- Compare page that loads products from Supabase by IDs

Next steps for you:
1) Run `supabase_full_migration.sql` in Supabase
2) Import `data/categories.csv` then `data/products.csv`
3) Promote your user to admin (see README/SUPABASE_SETUP.md)

After seeding, we can wire the public product listing to read live data with graceful fallback to current static content.
